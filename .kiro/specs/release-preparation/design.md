# Design Document: Release Preparation

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach for finalizing and polishing the BookDrive Chrome extension for its initial 1.0 release. The release preparation process encompasses code validation and completion, refactoring and cleanup, UI/UX enhancements, documentation updates, release management, CI/CD implementation, privacy compliance, and final quality assurance. The goal is to deliver a high-quality, production-ready extension that meets Chrome Web Store requirements and provides an excellent user experience.

## Architecture

The release preparation does not fundamentally change the architecture of the BookDrive extension but focuses on refining and completing the existing components. The current architecture consists of:
